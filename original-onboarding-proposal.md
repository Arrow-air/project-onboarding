# Quick Summary

### Project Creation

This is a proposal for a project called ‚ÄòOnboarding‚Äô. If approved, its status and funding details will be listed in [AIP-007](https://github.com/Arrow-air/dao-aips/blob/main/AIPs/AIP-007.md). A new Github repository called **‚Äòproject-onboarding‚Äô** ([link](https://github.com/Arrow-air/project-onboarding)) will be created and maintained containing all associated project files.

### Project Purpose

The project will be ongoing and it‚Äôs purpose is:

"To empower community members to contribute to Arrow‚Äôs mission by providing a welcoming, informative, and supportive environment that fosters unparalleled remote collaboration, learning, and growth.‚Äù

</aside>

### Project Scope

The project‚Äôs first round of funding will be used to address and improve:

1. Arrow‚Äôs website
2. Arrow‚Äôs documentation
3. Arrow‚Äôs onboarding documentation i.e. guides to contributing

Each of the sub-projects outlined above will run **sequentially (1>2>3)** and should each take between **4-6 weeks** to complete. It is expected these three milestones will be complete by **June 15th, 2025**.

### Project Leader

I, Sleety, am putting myself forward as Project Leader for ‚ÄòOnboarding‚Äô. If other contributors would like to undertake tasks that fall under the onboarding umbrella, I will be happy to work together to get funding for other necessary things to be done!

Examples could be writing guides, breakdowns, tutorials, gamification incentives for contributors, tokenomic incentives, codes of conduct, guidelines, welcome calls, communication channels, general documentation. Just some examples, there may be many more.

# Longer Summary

This application seeks funding for a project to enhance how Arrow is presented and how it interacts with the world. To attract top talent, we need clearly define our organization's purpose. With AIP-008 nearing completion, we‚Äôll have completed this hugely important step. The next step is to effectively communicate this purpose to the world.

This proposal is requesting the creation of a project called ‚ÄòOnboarding‚Äô. It is named ‚Äòonboarding‚Äô because every part of the project is geared to giving users a user-friendly way to **learn about Arrow** or a clear path to **contribute to Arrow.** This is how we grow a massive pool of contributing community members. 

### Scope of Project

The onboarding project will continue to exist even after these milestones are completed. Onboarding, or getting people to participate in Arrow, is an infinite game that will always require upkeep, reflection and improvement!

![Onboarding](https://github.com/Arrow-air/project-onboarding/assets/original-proposal/arrow-platform-pieces-lego@2x.png)

Getting people to participate in Arrow‚Äôs mission and community isn‚Äôt a product, but if we treat it as one, we need to address various aspects of the user experience. Let‚Äôs take each of these three areas separately and compare where we are now to where we want to be.

### Website

We need a reliable place to convincingly present our mission and act as a signpost to other aspects of the organization. We want to become the internet-native hub for collaboration? Well that all starts with an excellent website.

As a thought experiment, let‚Äôs imagine one million people visiting the Arrow website over the next year. The goal should be to create a website experience such that 950,000+ (i.e. 95%) of visitors leave with the following sentiment:

‚ÄúThis website is **clear and concise**. I understand the **mission** of this organization. It is obvious to me **where I go to communicate** with people in this organization and **get involved**. I believe this is an **honest community** with **good intentions**. I want to use my skills and participate in their mission. I found it easy to locate and view associated **project documentation** to evaluate the quality and scale of these efforts. This website served to **satisfy my queries** and/or signpost me to where my query could be answered.‚Äù

</aside>

### Documentation

To make the kind of impact Arrow wants to make upon the world, subpar documentation is not going to cut it. Remember, we‚Äôre an organization that relies on layers of open information, shared knowledge, to reach the heights of collaborative products out there in the real world.

Similar to the thought experiment above, what would the qualities be of organizational documentation that would unanimously satisfy all users?

- This documentation consistently exceeds my expectations
- This documentation cares deeply about education and understanding of its readers
- This documentation as organized as practical
- This documentation uses visuals where appropriate to vastly increase comprehension
- These docs use imagery, photos, graphics, charts, animations
- These docs use embedded CAD views, linted code embeds, reference videos
- These docs encourage me to participate (via GitHub) or via community discussions (forum)
- They should be modular and able to scale with Arrow's future growth
</aside>

### Onboarding

OK you have a beautiful, concise website - you have beautiful, organized docs. What next?

Well, in my experience the next question usually starts with a HOW. If we are in the business of recruiting vast amounts of distributed personnel, it is our responsibility to me more attuned than anyone else to ONBOARDING. Automated, asynchronous onboarding. From simple and expected queries like ‚Äúhow do I contribute to the docs‚Äù and ‚Äúhow do I sign up for Discord?‚Äù to more specific queries like ‚Äúhow do I apply for a grant‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat license does Arrow use‚Äù.

Treating every potential contributor to Arrow like they‚Äôre a paying customer. Dispelling stereotypes of Open Source development as being disorganised and impenetrable.

The building blocks of a successful community of contributors.

# Not In Scope

As much as I think there are other areas in need of attention at Arrow, I think the most fundamental areas outlined above fall neatly into (or around) my areas of expertise. After much thought, I believe this is the correct scope and order of milestones for maximal impact at Arrow. I am more than happy to address the next most pressing issue after completion of this project.

### Marketing

As much as I would love to do a content-driven barrage of marketing to show off our inspiring mission, it pains me to say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre ready for that, yet‚Äù. We need a solid platform first. The above three areas of concern are my best guess at the building blocks we need before we can confidently gather momentum. When we have:

- A fluff-free website, crystal clear distillation of our mission
- Beautiful documentation (around which our organizational success depends)
- More than enough onboarding paths to continue on the Arrow mission even if everyone currently contributing disappeared tomorrow. ü™¶

Once we have all three, all our marketing can be carried out with confidence, with this formula:

‚òëÔ∏é Interesting/Informative/Attention grabbing media

+ 

‚òëÔ∏é Link to docs/community to get involved 

+

‚òëÔ∏é Call to action

‚ôªÔ∏è¬†Rinse & Repeat daily

**Imagine a stream of content using this formula once our mission is abundantly clear, our docs are attractive and friendly and our onboarding (how to use) docs are automated and asynchronous.** 

# Onboarding Project Details

I have included some expanded project details below.

## Milestone 1: Website

### Deliverables

A refreshed website which is reflective of Arrow‚Äôs mission. The intention is for it to be biased towards clear and persuasive typography-led copy, alongside non-distracting imagery. The exact site map is to be determined by group meeting but will most likely include landing page, mission/about page, how to contribute, roadmap, community, bounty board, snapshot page.

- website
- feature: bounty board (90% complete, just needs re-skinned, previously funded, not included in this budget)
- feature: snapshot integration
- feature: discourse forum integration
- website images, icons, svgs, animations, 3d artwork, typography
- revised brand guide

### Meetings

From experience, writing consequential documents, such as the copy for the website, can be quite intimidating and difficult if you don‚Äôt have regular review sessions. To limit this inevitable friction, I think it‚Äôs best to have at least one meeting per week (ostensibly under #Growth) that covers some of the natural sticking points of web development. The onus will be on me as the project lead to arrange, lead and take notes for each of these meetings. Don‚Äôt worry, I will aim to make them as short and efficient as they can be by prepping an agenda.

- Meeting 1/5: Discuss proposed design and user experience of site
- Meeting 2/5: Define Sitemap and sections
- Meeting 3/5: Copywriting session/ asynchronous homework
- Meeting 4/5: Imagery presentation and critique
- Meeting 5/5: Website review and testing

### Budget

The proposed budget for Milestone 1 of the project is **$4.5k USDC**

The budget is derived from 60+ labor hours devoted to the project at Experience Level 5 compensation rate ($75). The reasoning is this is my area of expertise, outside of Arrow I run an in-demand design studio (tokenmotion.io) and my normal rate of comp is $100-120/hr, but I guess this could be considered a passion-project discount rate. Any hours beyond the 60 hour cap, I will absorb (i.e. for free). Arrow receives 100% accountable hours and a guarantee of deliverables without the risk of rising costs.

Included in the funding proposal is the idea of a ‚ÄòContributor Incentive Pot‚Äô -  a smaller fund where participation can be incentivized throughout the project. This would be distributed at the discretion of the Project Leader. An example would be overseeing and funding development of a Newsletter or writing an in-depth guide or a walkthrough of best practices.

### Timeline

I intend to begin once I receive funding, and work as fast as possible. I am projecting it will take me around 5 weeks. This may stretch to 6 weeks or more due to some unforeseen circumstances. Personally, I believe the desire to move efficiently onto the other milestones in the project is enough of an incentive to ensure speedy delivery of Milestone 1. When Milestone 1 is complete, as Project Leader, I will effectively pay myself from the labor via the project multisig. Likewise with Milestones 2 & 3.

## Milestone 2: Documentation

### Deliverables

- A [docs.arrowair.com](http://docs.arrowair.com) built on the GitBook platform
- well thought out and researched implementation
- Thorough accompanying style guide

### Meetings

A significant degree of liaising with DAO members (especially Engineering) is required to formulate the structure and best practices for documentation. I will take responsibility for setting dates and clear agendas for meetings to extract this information. The specific meeting topics and dates will be clarified closer to the time.

### End Goal

The goal with this milestone is to establish a platform for beautiful, accurate, informative and accessible documentation.
A downstream positive effect of engaging docs is that we foster a culture of detailed and beautifully presented documentation. It must be easy to navigate. Detail and care going into a projects documentation signals ambition.

Budget $7.8k (50% labor, 50% GitBook subscription - although we are eligible for a discount as we are open source - so the actual figure may be lower). Any funds remaining after GitBook subscription will be returned to DAO or remain available to Onboarding project.

## Milestone 3: Onboarding Documentation

The purpose of this sub-project is to create a significant amount of high quality documents that will help anyone new to Arrow can get an answer to the question "How do I get involved with this organization?".
### Deliverables

- 20+ step-by-step guides / useful overviews of our organizational to organizational processes
- adhering strictly to style guide established in previous milestone
- complete with media (video, graphics, diagrams) to make engaging with these docs a nice experience.

This serves as an exercise to establish a high standard of documentation right from the outset. It will act as an stress-test for the docs and bugs can be ironed out. Everyone new to Arrow will see high quality documentation right from their onboarding and understand that this is an organization that lives or dies by the quality of its documentation.

# Project Funding

An important preface to this is that I, Sleety will be reducing my Time Commitment Track compensation application by $1900/mo, so savings from the TCG budget can effectively be diverted to this project - which has the advantage of being a more explicit form of accountability.

The funding structure looks like this:

**Milestone 1:** $4500 (labor)

**Milestone 2:** $4000 (labor) + ~$3800/yr* eligible for discount

**Milestone 3:** $4000 (labor)

- surplus = $1500
- misc = $500

### Who is doing the work.

I am Gavin / Sleety and I‚Äôve been involved with Arrow from the start. I‚Äôve grown with Arrow and thought about how we can be better for years now. I see this project structure as a real opportunity to lean into my strengths as an experience freelance designer. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs my personality, or years of doing things a particular way, but I thrive best in my own space with my headphones on listening to the interstellar soundtrack. The wonderful thing about Arrow is that it allows me to seek concave approval from the community and execute in a familiar convex way.

With this project format, I get to solve problems with a degree of freedom. Through this freedom I get to think about solutions like its my own startup. I think a better product results from an environment like this, for me anyway.

### What next?

I would still like to tidy up this proposal based on feedback and make it compatible with AIP-006 & AIP-007. 

Approval of this project should follow the project creation process outlined in [AIP-006](https://github.com/Arrow-air/dao-aips/blob/main/AIPs/AIP-006.md).
